# wodb
A demonstration of using Beautiful Soup to download images from Mary Bourassa's 'Which One Doesn't Belong' site at http://wodb.ca .


Instructions for getting started:

1. Click on the Download ZIP button to the right to save all files to your computer. Extract the files into a directory.

2. You will also need to have Python 3.4 installed. Choose the link below that corresponds to your needs. 

For Mac OSX: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3-macosx10.6.pkg

For Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3.amd64.msi

3. After installing Python, Open the IDLE application. 

4. In the IDLE application menu, choose File->Open and then select the wodb.py file in the directory or folder holding the files you extracted in step 1. You can also do this by going to this folder, clicking on the wodb.py file, and running the file using IDLE.

5. Select F5 or go to the Run menu to run the script.

If the program is running correctly, you should see the names of each file pop up in the wodbimages directory one by one.

Now try changing the program yourself to download some of the other sets of images from the site.

Have fun!
